    "### > Used 'head()', 'describe()', 'info()' to examine the data structure.\n",
    "### > After examining the data , I intended to visualise it using a library called Matplotlib.\n",
    "### > Imported Matplotlib.pyplot as plt and created a scatter plot for Sepal Length and Petal Length to examine the distinction between the three species.\n",
    "### > Led to a conclusion that the Setosa species is on the lower end of the y axis while the other two tend to mostly overlap each other, leading to an observation that setosa has different physical characteristics.\n",
    "### > Plotted a histogram with Petal Length (in cm )on x-axis and frequency on the y-axis.\n",
    "### > Observed that there were two peaks in the histogram one near the 1.5 mark probably of Setosa and the other near the 5 mark probably due to the other two species on the x-axis.\n",
