# AI, ML, and Data Science Journey

## My Journey in AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science

Hi, I'm Satnam Singh ([![X Profile](https://img.shields.io/badge/X%20Profile-blue)](<x.com/WiredInSatnam>))! This repository documents my journey to become a top-tier AI/ML and Data Science engineer. I’m aiming for 15–20 projects, 7–8 Kaggle notebooks, and a ₹50 LPA+ or $50k+/year remote role in 12–15 months.

## Projects
- [Iris Dataset EDA](Projects/Iris_Data.ipynb): Explored the Iris dataset with Pandas and Matplotlib. [View on Kaggle](<https://www.kaggle.com/code/satnamsingh07/iris-data>)

## Learnings
### - [Machine Learning Specialization (Coursera)](Learnings/Machine_Learning_Specialization_by_Andrew_Ng/Course_Notes.ipynb): Notes from Andrew Ng’s ML Specialization.
### - [Iris Project Learnings (Week 1](Learnings/Iris_Project_Week_1.ipynb): Learnings from my Iris EDA project.

## LeetCode Progress
### - I’ll start LeetCode after completing my Machine Learning Specialization (estimated mid-June 2025).
